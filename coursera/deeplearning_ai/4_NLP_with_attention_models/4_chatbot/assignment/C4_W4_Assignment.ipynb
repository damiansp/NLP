    "Welcome to the last assignment of Course 4. Before you get started, we want to congratulate you on getting here. It is your 16th programming assignment in this Specialization and we are very proud of you! In this assignment, you are going to use the [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), also known as the efficient Transformer, to generate a dialogue between two bots. You will feed conversations to your model and it will learn how to understand the context of each one. Not only will it learn how to answer questions but it will also know how to ask questions if it needs more info. For example, after a customer asks for a train ticket, the chatbot can ask what time the said customer wants to leave. You can use this concept to automate call centers, hotel receptions, personal trainers, or any type of customer service. By completing this assignment, you will:\n",

The key idea is that we will start with two copies of the input to the model and at each layer we will only update one of them. The activations that we *don’t* update are the ones that will be used to compute the residuals. \n",

Before doing the second equation (i.e. second half of the reversible residual), it first needs to swap the elements to take into account the stack semantics in Trax. It simply puts `x2` on top of the stack so it can be fed to the add block of the half-residual layer. It then swaps the two outputs again so it can be fed to the next layer of the network. All of these arrives at the two equations in Part 3 and it can be used to recompute the activations during the backward pass.\n",
